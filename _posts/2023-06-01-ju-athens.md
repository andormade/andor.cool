During my trip to Athens, I stayed in this really cool Airbnb above a Greek restaurant. To get in, I had to go through the kitchen, and they even gave me keys to the restaurant! It felt a bit weird, but the place was beautifully decorated.

The only thing was, whenever the restaurant below was open, the air would be filled with the smell of fries. But honestly, it kind of added to the whole charm of the place.
