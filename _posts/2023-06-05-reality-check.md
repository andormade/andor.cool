I never have bad dreams, and I recently realized why. Whenever something bad happens, I immediately start questioning reality. I’m always like, "Oh no, this can’t be happening to me; it must be just a bad dream." Then, I usually realize that I am actually dreaming, so I just fly away from my problems like Neo.
