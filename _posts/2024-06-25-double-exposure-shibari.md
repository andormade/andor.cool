<p>This was my first go at doing double exposures. I shot two rolls of film with Dolf tying Sick Ducks, then reloaded the same films and shot them again, but this time with a bunch of candles I'd set up on a desk with a black background.</p>

<p>To get the frames to line up perfectly, most photographers use a pen to mark the lines of the first frame on the film, so when they load it again, they know how to position the film. I kinda skipped that step, so I had no clue where the candles were gonna end up in the final images.

<p>Itâ€™s super rewarding to see them align just right, it almost feels like magic.</p>
