You know how habits from our waking life often find their way into our dreams? 
For example, if you're a smoker, you are probably smoking in your dreams as well. 
It turns out this also applies to songs stuck in your head. 
I realized this when the song "Bright Eyes" became an earworm for me. 
The opening line, "Is it a kind of dream?" worked as a reality check, and I realized I was actually dreaming.
