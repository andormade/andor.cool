Plugging the Mutable Instruments Rings module directly into Clouds is a popular clich√©/meme amongst the modular ambient producers. Since I don't have a Rings, I have attached my Spieluhr to the Erica Synths Pico Case, which turned out to have great acoustics. The sound was picked up by the Mutable Music Things Ears piezo module.
