The Buzludzha Monument is a large concrete building located on a mountain peak in Bulgaria. It was built in the 1970s as a tribute to the Bulgarian Communist Party and was used as a meeting place for the party's rallies and events.

Since the fall of communism in Bulgaria in 1989, the Buzludzha Monument has fallen into disrepair and is no longer used for its original purpose. It has become a popular destination for urban explorers and tourists interested in the country's communist past.
