Hello, I'm Andor Polgar, and I like to rant about random things. For example, I've always thought it was a bit strange how some people write their bios in the third person. I've been told it's the professional way to do it, and I've even been asked to write mine like that, but I cringe every time I try. So, I hope you don't mind if I keep things first-person here. My goal is to write such a detailed bio that it could be used to create an AI chatbot with my personality, so people could steal my identity.

I was born into a family of first-generation intellectuals right around the time when the Soviet onion was falling apart, and I grew up in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. It was a brand-new world, not just for me as a baby, but also for my parents and everyone else, as we stepped into an age of possibilities. It was exciting, but not everything was for the better. A lot of people had a Stockholm syndrome-esque attachment to the old authoritarian ways and corruption, clinging to a past that should have been left behind. That's partly why, after finishing school, I decided to start a new life somewhere else.

As a kid, I was hyperfixated on computer programming and technology. I was lucky enough that my parents could afford a computer, however, I didn't have a mentor during those formative years, so I had to figure things out on my own, which took a bit longer. Driven by my obsession, I managed to publish my first website during the summer after I finished 4th grade. I found out that our ISP, for some strange reason, provided an FTP server with a preconfigured HTTP server as part of our internet subscription. I figured out how to upload HTML files by reverse engineering the source code of early internet websites.

I've discovered that my brain is wired in a way that makes solving problems feel incredibly rewarding, which has made software engineering the perfect job for me. These days, I work as a freelance software consultant, mostly from my home office in the Netherlands, but I often travel as a digital nomad.

I really enjoy taking photos of people and documenting my life. It's a way for me to connect and create with like-minded artists. I do this purely for my own enjoyment; I'm not after fame, a lasting legacy, or anything like that. While I like the occasional recognition and attention, I'm not concerned about the afterlife of my work. Honestly, even if someone ended up using my photos as their own, it wouldn't upset me at all. What matters most to me is the process of creating these images and looking back at them later when I've already forgotten about their existence. They're like little time capsules for me, bringing back precious memories.

I'm fascinated by the idea of humanity creating an artificial superintelligence. I think it's a very exciting time to be alive! Whenever I'm asked which year I would choose to be reborn in or time travel back to if given the choice, I always choose the present. There's no other era I'd rather experience than the one we're living in right now.

Some random facts about me:
- I collect naïve art, and I own an original piece painted by Hide the Pain Harold.
- I keep a log of all the places I've visited since 2010—not just cities and countries, but also all the restaurants, bus stops, and highway gas stations.
- I spent a week in North Korea in 2019.
- I can control and be aware of my dreams while I'm dreaming.
- I made an artsy porn short film that won awards and was screened in cinemas and film festivals around the world.
- I can teach tricks to cats, like jumping over people, jumping through hoops, and ringing bells.
- I like experimenting with altered states of consciousness. (For legal reasons, I need to clarify that all my explorations are conducted using methods that are completely legal worldwide, especially in countries where I may apply for a visa in the future. These are non-pharmacological methods, such as meditation and sleep deprivation.)
- I’m currently learning shibari, the Japanese art of rope bondage.
- I have homochromia, which means both of my eyes are the same color.
