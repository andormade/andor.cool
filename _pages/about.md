<p>Hello, I'm Andor Polgar, I was born into a family of first-generation intellectuals right around the time when the Soviet onion was falling apart, and I grew up in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. It was a brand-new world, not just for me as a baby, but also for my parents and everyone else, as we stepped into an age of possibilities. It was exciting, but not everything was for the better. A lot of people had a Stockholm syndrome-esque attachment to the old authoritarian ways and corruption, clinging to a past that should have been left behind. That's partly why, after finishing school, I decided to start a new life somewhere else.</p>

<p>As a kid, I was hyperfixated on computer programming and technology. I was lucky enough that my parents could afford a computer, however, I didn't have a mentor during those formative years, so I had to figure things out on my own, which took a bit longer. I've discovered that my brain is wired in a way that makes solving problems feel incredibly rewarding, which has made software engineering the perfect job for me. These days, I work as a freelance software consultant, mostly from my home office in the Netherlands, but I often travel as a digital nomad.</p>

<p>I really enjoy taking photos of people and documenting my life. It's a way for me to connect and create with like-minded artists. I do this purely for my own enjoyment; I'm not after fame, a lasting legacy, or anything like that. While I like the occasional recognition and attention, I'm not concerned about the afterlife of my work. Honestly, even if someone ended up using my photos as their own, it wouldn't upset me at all. What matters most to me is the process of creating these images and looking back at them later when I've already forgotten about their existence. They're like little time capsules for me, bringing back precious memories.</p>

<p>I'm fascinated by the idea of humanity creating an artificial superintelligence. I think it's a very exciting time to be alive! Whenever I'm asked which year I would choose to be reborn in or time travel back to if given the choice, I always choose the present. There's no other era I'd rather experience than the one we're living in right now.</p>
