Hey, I'm Andor Polgar. I was born shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union and raised in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. It was a brand-new world not just for me as a baby, but also for my parents and everyone else, as we stepped into an age of possibilities. But even as a kid, I could see that not everything was changing for the better. Many people seemed stuck in old patterns, almost as if they missed the old authoritarian ways and the corruption that came with them. Seeing all this, I decided the best for me was to start fresh somewhere else after I finished school.

As a child, I was hyperfixated towards computer programming and technology. Despite not having a mentor during those early years, my fixation led me to figure things out on my own (though it took a bit longer). Fast forward to today, I'm working as a freelancer software consultant, mostly from the comfort of my home office in the Netherlands.

I love taking photos of people and documenting my life. For me, it's a way to connect with like-minded artists and create togeter. Plus, the nostalgia I feel when looking at old photos gives me a blissful dopamine rush.

I'm absolutely fascinated by the idea of humanity creating a general superintelligence, the progress and possibilities in this area are truly blowing my mind. It's a very exciting time to be alive!
