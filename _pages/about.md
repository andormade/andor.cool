Hey, I'm Andor Polgar, I was born shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union and raised in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. I didn't stay much longer, I already spent over 80% of my adult life living and working in different countries abroad.

As a child, I was hyperfixated towards computer programming and technology. Despite not having a mentor during those early years, my fixation led me to figure things out on my own (though it took a bit longer).

Fast forward to today, I'm working as a freelancer software consultant, mostly from the comfort of my home office in the Netherlands.

I love taking photos of people and documenting my life. For me, it's a way to connect with like-minded artists and create togeter. Plus, the nostalgia I feel when looking at old photos gives me a blissful dopamine rush.

I'm absolutely fascinated by the idea of humanity creating a general superintelligence, the progress and possibilities in this area are truly blowing my mind. It's a very exciting time to be alive!
