Hello, I'm Andor Polgar. I've always found it odd how people write their biographies in the third person. Although I've been told that it's the professional approach and have often been requested to do the same, I simply can't bring myself to do it. The mere attempt makes me cringe immediately. So, please forgive me for continuing my bio in the first person.

I was born into a family of first-generation intellectuals shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union and raised in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. It was a brand-new world not just for me as a baby, but also for my parents and everyone else, as we stepped into an age of possibilities. But even as a kid, I could see that not everything was changing for the better. Many people had a Stockholm syndrome-esque attachment to the old authoritarian ways and corruption, clinging to a past that should have been left behind. Seeing all this, I decided that starting fresh somewhere else after finishing school would be the best path for me.

As a kid, I was hyperfixated towards computer programming and technology. Despite not having a mentor during those early years, my fixation led me to figure things out on my own (though it took a bit longer). I've discovered that my brain is wired in a way that makes solving problems feel incredibly rewarding, which has made software development the perfect job for me. Fast forward to today, I'm working as a freelance software consultant, mostly from my home in the Netherlands, but I often travel as a digital nomad. I try to be mindful of the places I choose, preferring countries where the presence of digital nomads hasn't been causing controversies.

I love taking photos of people and documenting my life. It's a way for me to connect and create with like-minded artists. Also, looking at old photos always gives me a nice dopamine rush from the good memories they bring back. I'm not driven by the desire to build a legacy or achieve lasting fame as an artist, my art is purely for my own enjoyment. While I do appreciate the occasional recognition and attention it brings, the afterlife of my work doesn't concern me. In fact, the thought of someone else downloading my creations and claiming them as their own doesn't bother me at all. For me, the true value lies in the process and the joy it brings in the moment.

I'm absolutely fascinated by the idea of humanity creating a general superintelligence, the progress and possibilities in this area are truly blowing my mind. It's a very exciting time to be alive!
