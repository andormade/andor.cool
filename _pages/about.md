Hello, I'm Andor Polgar. I've always found it amusing how people write their biographies in the third person. Although I've been frequently advised that it's a professional approach and have often been requested to do the same, I simply can't bring myself to do it. The mere attempt makes me cringe immediately. So, please forgive me for continuing my bio in the first person.

I was born into a family of first-generation intellectuals shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union and raised in the suburbs of a small city in post-communist Hungary. It was a brand-new world not just for me as a baby, but also for my parents and everyone else, as we stepped into an age of possibilities. But even as a kid, I could see that not everything was changing for the better. Many people had a Stockholm syndrome-esque attachment to the old authoritarian ways and corruption, clinging to a past that should have been left behind. Seeing all this, I decided that starting fresh somewhere else after finishing school would be the best path for me.

As a child, I was hyperfixated towards computer programming and technology. Despite not having a mentor during those early years, my fixation led me to figure things out on my own (though it took a bit longer). Fast forward to today, I'm working as a freelance software consultant, mostly from the comfort of my home office in the Netherlands.

I love taking photos of people and documenting my life. For me, it's a way to connect with like-minded artists and create togeter. Also, looking at old photos always gives me a nice dopamine rush from the good memories they bring back.

I'm absolutely fascinated by the idea of humanity creating a general superintelligence, the progress and possibilities in this area are truly blowing my mind. It's a very exciting time to be alive!
