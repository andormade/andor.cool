A Flor de Piel is an experimental post-porn short film shot entirely on an analog 35mm rangefinder camera. 

The title is a Spanish idiomatic expression that literally translates to ‚Äúlike the flower of skin‚Äú. The phrase conveys an overt display of emotion. It is similar to the English expression of ‚Äúwearing one&apos;s heart on one&apos;s sleeve‚Äú.

Some technical details: the entire motion picture was shot on 30 rolls of Ilford HP5 Plus film, they were developed by hand in Ilford ID-11. Most of the rolls were push processed by 1 or 2 exposure values.

Lenses used: Zeiss ZM 50mm F/2.0 Planar T* and Zeiss ZM 35mm F/2.0 Biogon T*, Camera: Leica M6 TTL (1984).

The frames were digitized by re-photographing them from the negatives using a Nikon D780 DSLR camera with a Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM macro lens.

The individual frames were edited in Lightroom, and then stitched together with FFmpeg. The excessive amount of dust and dirt was transferred onto the film during the digitization process.
