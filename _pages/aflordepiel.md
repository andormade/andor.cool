A Flor de Piel is an experimental short film in the post-porn genre, which was entirely shot using an analog 35mm rangefinder camera. 

The film's title is a Spanish idiom that literally means “like the flower of skin“. The expression refers to the outward display of one's emotions and is similar to the English phrase “wearing one&apos;s heart on one&apos;s sleeve“.

Some technical details: the entire motion picture was shot on 30 rolls of Ilford HP5 Plus film, they were developed by hand in Ilford ID-11. Most of the rolls were push processed by 1 or 2 exposure values.

Lenses used: Zeiss ZM 50mm F/2.0 Planar T* and Zeiss ZM 35mm F/2.0 Biogon T*, Camera: Leica M6 TTL (1984).

The frames were digitized by re-photographing them from the negatives using a Nikon D780 DSLR camera with a Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM macro lens.

The individual frames were edited in Lightroom, and then stitched together with FFmpeg. The excessive amount of dust and dirt was transferred onto the film during the digitization process.
