In case I get hit by a bus...

In the software industry the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">Bus factor</a>&quot; is an often talked about problem. I don't care who and how is going to take over my open source projects, my only concern is that the web services that keep this website (with all of its content) online will stop running at some point.

I made these archives in an effort to make sure that all the content and data that I've accumulated during my lifetime will outlive me.
