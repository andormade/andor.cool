Hey friends, in the unfortunate event that I get hit by a bus, I want to make you aware that my digital artifacts and online presence will only be accessible for a limited time.

All of my photos, videos, and documents are stored on a server at DigitalOcean. My account and associated domain names will only last for a year from the time of my passing, and after that all my files will be deleted.

To ensure that my digital legacy is preserved, I would be honored if you could save any digital memories or documents that hold significance to you, before they are deleted.

Thank you for being a part of my life.

Forever yours, Andor
