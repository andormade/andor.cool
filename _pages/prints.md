<p>I really appreciate your interest in my work, but I don’t get enough requests to justify setting up a webshop and doing limited-edition prints.</p>

<p>You are welcome to download any photo from this website and print it at your local print shop for personal use. Just click on a photo, and the original high-quality JPEG will pop up for you to use.</p>

<p>If you print one of my photos, I’d love it if you shared the result with me. It would make me the happiest person to know that someone liked my work enough to do that. I’d love to see how it turns out!</p>
