<p>Have you ever thought about why you buy art?</p>

<p>Is it because you find pleasure seeing it in a physical format, taking in the details up close?</p>

<p>Or maybe it’s about decorating your space, sending  social signals, telling people how much you paid for it?</p>

<p>Or simply enjoying the idea that you own something exclusive from a first edition limited run?</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, these are all valid reasons, but what if I told you that I’m not selling prints at all, and you’re free to download any image from my website and print it as large as you like?</p>

<p>Would that make you feel disappointed?</p>

<p>Would that change how you feel about owning art?</p>
