<p>Hello, I am Andor Polgár. "Polgár Hivatal" is the name of my consultancy. I'm a self-taught software developer from Hungary, now based in the Netherlands. I've been writing code for 20 years (15 of those professionally). TypeScript is my main language, but I'm also comfortable with C, Rust, and several others. I consult with companies on web development, with a focus on the client side.
