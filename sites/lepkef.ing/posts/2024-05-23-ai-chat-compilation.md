Browsing through the chat histories of the AI chatbots and copilots I use often makes me cringe or laugh at the questions I asked. Sometimes, I don't even remember the context anymore, which makes them more bizarre or funny. Here are some of the strangest questions I asked this year so far:

Is it normal to feel violent after a hard workout? Sometimes, I have an urge to punch something for no  reason on my way home from the gym.

What is the best way to respond when someone stutters? Should I try to guess what they are trying to say, or is it better to wait patiently until they finish speaking?

What do colombians usually do at around 8 PM? We recently launched an adult site targeted at the Colombian market and have noticed a significant decline in traffic after 8 PM each day.

Is it true that telenovelas have a negative impact on web traffic in latin american countires?

Could you write some news article titles that would make conservative people angry?

Can you explain me the Busy Beaver function?

Who is responsible for killing Jesus?

Do you know the origin of the phrase "you are what you eat"?

Can you improve this review? "This hotel hires scammers to persuade random people online to write 5 star reviews on their google maps page in exchange for money."

Is there a term for when people's perception of a person's gender changes depending on geographical location?
