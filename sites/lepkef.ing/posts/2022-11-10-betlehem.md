Dear Andrew,

I hope this postcard finds you well. I am writing to you from Palestine, and I have been truly inspired by the resilience and strength of the Palestinian people.

We have been able to see firsthand the impact of the ongoing conflict, which has been both heart-wrenching and eye-opening. Despite the challenges, the Palestinian people have been incredibly warm and welcoming to us.

I'm having an amazing time and wish you were here to experience it with me. I'll make sure to take lots of pictures and tell you all about it when I get back.
