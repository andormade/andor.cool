This is photography on hard mode: a fully manual Rollei 35 Classic with only a viewfinder, so zone focusing all the way. No light meter either, (the battery was dead) so I eyeballed exposure with sunny 16. To top it off, I used a new experimental film stock with almost no exposure latitude. Basically, every frame was a gamble.
