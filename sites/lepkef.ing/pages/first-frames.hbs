    <h2>First Frames</h2>

    <p>Every frame of a film roll is valuable. A kind of value I could exchange for instant happiness, like half a bar
        of
        dark chocolate. (as of 2024)<br />
        But instead, I take my time, carefully arranging the model, finding a new pose for every shot. No two can be the
        same, that would be wasteful.<br />
        I double-check the settings over and over to make sure nothing goes to waste.<br />
        And then they tell me to skip the first frame because itâ€™s already been exposed to light during loading.<br />
        Yeah, right!</p>
