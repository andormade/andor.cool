# andor.cool

Hello there! üëã You just found the source code of my personal website. It's powered by a static site generator I wrote in Rust, without using any third-party libraries. This whole project has been a personal playground for me to improve my, let‚Äôs say, ‚Äúrusty‚Äù Rust skills. Originally, I was planning to write this in C, but Netlify still doesn't support deploying C projects.

## Requirements

To run the website locally, make sure you have the following installed:
- Rust: The project is developed in Rust, so you'll need the Rust compiler and Cargo (its package manager) installed on your system.

## Installation

To get the website running on your local machine, follow these steps:

    git clone https://github.com/hngrhorace/andor.cool.git
    cd andor.cool
    cargo run
