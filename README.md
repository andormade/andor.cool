# andor.cool

Hello there! üëã You just found the source code of my personal website. It's powered by a static site generator I wrote in Rust, without using any third-party libraries. This whole project is a playground for me to improve my ‚Äúrusty‚Äù Rust skills. Originally, I wanted to write it in C, but Netlify still doesn't support deploying C projects. :( 

For storing the content, I'm using Markdown files with Front Matter, and with Liquid and Handlebars templates. I was inspired by Jekyll, which uses a similar structure for content management.

The design was inspired by Mac OS 9, you can steal the CSS from my codepen: [https://codepen.io/hngrhorace/pen/gbYKpxE](https://codepen.io/hngrhorace/pen/gbYKpxE)

## Requirements

To run the website locally, make sure you have the following installed:
- Git

    git clone https://github.com/hngrhorace/andor.cool.git
