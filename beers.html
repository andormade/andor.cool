<h2>Beerlog</h2>

<p>These below are all the beers I have tasted since April 11, 2017.</p>

{% assign beer_files = site.data.lifelogging.beer %}

{% for beer_file in beer_files reversed %}
	{% for beer in beer_file[1] reversed %}
		<h3>{{ beer.name }}</h3>
		<p>{{ beer }}</p>
	{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
