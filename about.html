<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is Andor, I'm a hungarian software developer living in Haarlem, North Holland. I enjoy making music with my modular synthesizers and documenting my life through photography. I currently work as a senior front-end developer for one of the most visited adult sites on the whole internet.</p>
